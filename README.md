## Known Issues / Challenges

Challenges will be narrowing the scope of the question down to something manageable.  I would like to start with questions about the actual cost of college by state and contrast that with the median salary a person earns depending on their location and education attained.
●	I should not have to request data or an API key.  It should be contained on the US census data website and National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) website.
●	I will have to change some labels in CSV files and use SQL to make final tables and to create aggregates.

●	I need to have an equation that defines how long it takes to pay back student loans.  There are calculators online that calculate this.  I can hopefully use the same equation that they do to define loan pay off time.
●	US census data is not arranged in an easily usable way.  I’ll probably have to change some column headers and data organization in order to use the data.
